                      means the column is considered sensitive. INVALID means the
                      column is not considered sensitive. Tracking invalid columns
                      in a sensitive data model helps ensure that an incremental data
                      discovery job does not identify these columns as sensitive.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      relationship between columns in a sensitive data model. Note
                      that the parent column must be added to the sensitive data model

                      the appDefinedChildColumnKeys or dbDefinedChildColumnKeys attribute
                      of the parent column is automatically updated to reflect the
                      relationship.

                      that the relationship is defined in the database dictionary.
                      APP_DEFINED indicates that the relationship is defined at the
                      application level and not in the database dictionary.

                      in a sensitive data model helps ensure that an incremental data
