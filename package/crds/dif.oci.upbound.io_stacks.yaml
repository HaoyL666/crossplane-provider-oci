                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
