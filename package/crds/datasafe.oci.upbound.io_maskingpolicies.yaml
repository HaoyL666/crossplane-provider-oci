                      the temporary tables. Masking creates temporary tables that
                      map the original sensitive  data values to mask values. By default,
                      these temporary tables are dropped after masking. But, in some
                      cases, you may want  to preserve this information to track how
                      masking changed your data. Note that doing so compromises security.
                      These tables  must be dropped before the database is available

                      these temporary tables are dropped after masking. But, in some
                      cases, you may want  to preserve this information to track how
                      masking changed your data. Note that doing so compromises security.
                      These tables  must be dropped before the database is available
                      for unprivileged users.

                      unmasked  data from logs. However, in certain circumstances
                      when you only want to test masking, rollback changes, and retry
                      masking, you could enable logging and use a flashback database

                      these temporary tables are dropped after masking. But, in some
                      cases, you may want  to preserve this information to track how
                      masking changed your data. Note that doing so compromises security.
                      These tables  must be dropped before the database is available
                      for unprivileged users.

                    description: (Updatable) Indicates if redo logging is enabled
                      during a masking operation. It's disabled by default. Set this
                      attribute to true to enable redo logging. By default, masking
                      disables redo logging and flashback logging to purge any original
                      unmasked  data from logs. However, in certain circumstances
                      when you only want to test masking, rollback changes, and retry
                      masking, you could enable logging and use a flashback database
                      to retrieve the original unmasked data after it has been masked.

                      to disable statistics gathering. The masking process gathers
                      statistics on masked database tables after masking completes.

                      (no parallelism), 'DEFAULT' (the Oracle Database computes the
                      optimum degree of parallelism) or an integer value to be used
                      as the degree of parallelism. Parallel execution helps effectively
                      use multiple CPUs and improve masking performance. Refer to
                      the Oracle Database parallel execution framework when choosing
                      an explicit degree of parallelism.
