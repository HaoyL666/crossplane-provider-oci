                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
